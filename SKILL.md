# Appraisal AI — Report Drafting Pipeline

Generates **Word narrative drafts with tracked changes** and **Excel adjustment grids** from master templates and project workfile data. Every substitution is visible in Word Review mode — accept or reject each change.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the `appraisal_ai` repo installed locally:

```
~/appraisal_ai/
├── scripts/utils.py          — core utilities
├── templates/<pack-name>/    — template packs (narrative.docx, grid.xlsx, reference-data.md)
├── .claude/agents/           — agent specs for the pipeline
├── .claude/skills/           — slash command definitions
├── CLAUDE.md                 — full rules, workflow, and lessons learned
└── requirements.txt          — Python dependencies
```

Set up the virtual environment (one time):

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/appraisal_ai/venv
~/appraisal_ai/venv/bin/pip install -r ~/appraisal_ai/requirements.txt
```

Always run scripts with `~/appraisal_ai/venv/bin/python`.

## Project Folder Structure

Each appraisal project uses this layout:

```
2026-NNN Address/
├── Subject/         — engagement letter, assessor card, deed, LOI, CoStar
├── Narrative/       — output drafts go here
├── Comparables/     — comp sheets, CoStar/MLS printouts, sale data
├── Exhibits/        — maps, photos, figures
└── Template/        — completed appraisal .docx and grid .xlsx
```

## Pipeline (5 Phases)

The full pipeline dispatches 10 agents across 5 phases.

### Phase 1 — Read (3 agents, parallel)
Subject Reader, Comp Reader, Exhibit Reader scan all project documents. PDFs are split before reading with `split_pdf()` from `scripts/utils.py` (3 pages/chunk for scanned docs, 5 for text-heavy).

### Phase 2 — Extract (2 agents, parallel → pause)
Field Extractor builds `data.md`. Comp Grid Agent builds `comp_grid.md`. **Pauses for user review** of `*** UPDATE ***` and `*** VERIFY ***` fields before continuing.

### Phase 3 — Build (3 steps)
Comp Writer generates `comp_writeups.md` from source documents → then Draft Builder + Grid Builder run in parallel. Draft uses Word XML tracked changes (`w:del` + `w:ins`). Grid writes to named Excel sheets (never `wb.active`).

### Phase 4 — Review (2 agents, parallel)
QA Reviewer checks data consistency. USPAP Reviewer checks compliance. Auto-fix loop runs up to 2 iterations — rebuild is mandatory after every fix.

### Phase 5 — Final Review (blocks delivery)
Cross-check grid vs. narrative vs. data.md. Verify tracked changes, formula cells preserved, adjustment rows untouched. **No files delivered to the user until Phase 5 passes.**

## Data Files

Project data uses structured Markdown:

- `data.md` — project fields (address, dates, values, parties, etc.)
- `comp_grid.md` — comparable sale data (price, SF, date, grantor/grantee)
- `comp_writeups.md` — narrative prose for each comparable sale
- `templates/<type>/reference-data.md` — template replacement values

Load and save with `load_md()` / `save_md()` from `scripts/utils.py`.

## Template Packs

Each pack in `templates/<name>/` contains:

- `narrative.docx` — master template (user-provided, not in git)
- `grid.xlsx` — adjustment grid template (optional, user-provided)
- `reference-data.md` — every replaceable text string extracted from the template (literal-text anchor mode)

Custom packs follow the same structure. The user supplies their own completed appraisal as the master template.

**Two anchor modes.** Literal-text matching (`reference-data.md`, default —
`.claude/skills/draft.md`) works for prose narratives. Dense tabular templates
where identical literals ("-", "20") mean different things by position — the
common case for Arabic/RTL packs (صك/مخطط/حدود أربعة/تواريخ هجرية) — should use
highlight-anchor matching instead: `reference-data.json` with
`"anchor_mode": "highlight"`, position + yellow-highlight only, never text
match. See `.claude/skills/draft-highlight.md` and the worked example in
`templates/demo-ksa/`.

## Key Utilities (`scripts/utils.py`)

- `extract_docx_text(path)` — extract text from .docx (never read .docx with file tools — it's binary XML)
- `extract_xlsx_text(path)` — extract text from .xlsx
- `split_pdf(path, pages_per_chunk)` — split large PDFs into readable chunks
- `load_md(path)` / `save_md(data, path)` — structured Markdown data I/O
- Tracked change builders: `tracked_replace_in_run()`, `tracked_replace_across_runs()`, `tracked_delete_paragraph()`
- Table helpers: `find_table_by_text()`, `set_cell_text()`, `add_table_row()`
- Word XML safety: `next_change_id()`, `get_date()`, `make_tracked_delete()`

## Word XML — Mandatory on Every Save

Three rules prevent Word "unreadable content" errors:

1. **Double-quote XML declaration.** `etree.tostring()` outputs single quotes — replace with double quotes after every serialize.
2. **`<w:delText>` inside `<w:del>`.** Deleted text must use `<w:delText>`, not `<w:t>`. Use `make_tracked_delete()`.
3. **Unique `w:id` + `w:date`** on every `<w:del>` and `<w:ins>`. Use `next_change_id()` and `get_date()`.

## Critical Rules

- **All Word replacements must use tracked changes** — never direct `w:t` text replacement
- **Never use `wb.active`** for Excel — always open sheets by name
- **Never overwrite adjustment rows** — those are appraiser professional judgment
- **Never overwrite grid cells with `*** UPDATE ***`** — leave template values if data is missing
- **If it's not in the workfile, it doesn't exist** — flag unsupported template artifacts for removal
- **Report truths, don't make appraiser judgments** — adjustments, comp selection, and value conclusions are the appraiser's call
- **Deed-first for grantor/grantee** — read deeds first, cross-check against CoStar, report mismatches
- **Mandatory rebuild after auto-fix** — never skip, even for one small fix
